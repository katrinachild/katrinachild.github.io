<p><span class=emphasis>I offer psychotherapy and consultation for adult individuals and couples in San Francisco</span>, providing personalized, thoughtful support and guidance to help you create more satisfaction and success in your life. I also train and supervise psychotherapy interns. I've been working with clients since 1992, and I have experience working with people of diverse backgrounds, ages and lifestyles. I also work with people creating startups, and offer group counseling and mediation for co-founders. </p>

<p><span class=emphasis>People seek therapy for a variety of reasons but it usually stems from a desire to feel better.</span> Often people are seeking more from themselves, their relationships, their work, and their lives. People may also want to feel better about themselves, or are struggling to accept and deal with changes or circumstances they didn't choose, or to end self-defeating patterns of behavior. When you come to therapy we will work together to understand clearly how you came to be who and where you are. </p>

<p>I combine depth psychotherapy with practical, solution-oriented counseling. Our work will help you understand your desires and fears, and learn from them.  I am inquisitive, curious  and warm, and I use humor and compassion in my work. I truly love the process of collaborating together to help you discover <span class=emphasis>and live a more meaningful, satisfying and authentic life</span>. </p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">I believe that in addition to a therapist's training and experience, <span class=emphasis>finding a therapist who is suited to you is crucial to a successful therapy experience.</span>  I am happy to talk with you on the phone to hear more about what you are seeking, and from there we can either set up a time to meet, or I will provide you with referrals to help you find what you need.</p>
