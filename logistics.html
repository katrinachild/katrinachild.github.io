<p ><span class=qualhead>Location</span><br>My office is located on 24th Street, in Noe Valley, San Francisco. It can be reached by Muni via the J Church or the 24 bus line and is a 10 minute walk from the 24th street BART station. There is a small public parking lot a few doors down. </p>
 
 <p><span class=qualhead>Sessions</span><br>Sessions are generally 50 minutes long, but I also offer 75 and 100 minute sessions if we decide it would be helpful. Typically we will meet weekly, although you may choose to come more or less often. </p>
 
 <p><span class=qualhead>Qualifications</span><br>I have an MFT license (license #36365).  MFT stands for Marriage and Family Therapist; it is a license to practice individual and couples therapy as well. MFTs are required to obtain a Master's level degree, complete 3000 hours of supervised training, and pass a competitive written and then oral exam.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><span class=qualhead>Getting Started</span><br>When we first talk we will discuss what's bringing you to seek therapy, scheduling, fees, insurance, and any other questions you may have about my experience and practice. If you feel I could be helpful to you, we'll schedule an initial session.  The initial session is an opportunity for you to meet me, share with me more about what is bringing you to seek therapy and to ask me any questions you may have.  This also gives you a sense of how I work and how you will feel talking with me.  If, for whatever reason, it doesn't feel like the right fit for you, I will provide you with some referrals so that you can find the right therapist for you and your needs.
